# ScorePercentage
Replaces the "Rank" in Level End Screen with score percentage and adds score percentage to the "Highscore" in the Level Selection Menu.

**Warning: Percentage on menu screen will be incorrect when your highscore was set using modifiers, since Beat Saber only saves score without modifier information.**
